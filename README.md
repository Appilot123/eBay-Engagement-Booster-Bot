<h1 align="center">eBay Engagement Booster Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project is designed to simulate human-like engagement on eBay listings—automatically boosting views, favorites, and cart additions—to increase the perceived popularity and trustworthiness of products. It’s especially useful for sellers looking to improve social proof and click-through rates without relying on paid ads.

The bot works by logging into multiple stealth eBay accounts (or guest sessions) and interacting with specified listings using randomized timings, proxy rotation, and unique device fingerprints. While originally inspired by a marketplace thread seeking such tools, this bot provides a complete, stable, and scalable solution for sellers and blackhat marketers alike.


## Core Features:
- **Proxy-Based Session Management:** Supports rotating residential/mobile proxies to bypass detection and location-based limits.
- **Realistic Human Simulation:** Each bot session mimics natural user behavior—scrolls, delays, click paths—to avoid raising flags.
- **Modular & Scalable:** Easily scale up to hundreds of sessions using Dockerized workers and custom thread management.
